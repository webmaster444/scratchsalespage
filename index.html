	<p>Dear Frustrated Golfer,</p>
	<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar...</p>
	<br/>
	<p>After a nice tee shot that finds the middle of the fairway, you have 110 yards to the pin and you're licking your chops.</p>
	<br/>
	<p> You imagine yourself hitting a flush wedge inside 8 feet,knocking in the birdie putt, and strolling to the next tee confidently.</p>
	<br/>

	<p><strong>Then it happens...</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Chunk.</strong></p>
<br/>
	<p><strong>You feel your wdge dig into the ground two inches behind the ball,</strong> and lok up to see your ball has flown a grand total of 30 yards.</p>

	<p>After embrrassingly walking to your ball, knocking it on the green, and prompty 3 putting, you walk off the green with a double bogey.</p>

	<br/>
	<p>All the while a few of your buddies(who you'll probably now lose a bet with) are watching this catastrophe unfold right in front of them</p>

			<p>After driving home from the course mad at the world, you get home, fire up your laptop, and find some instructional videos to help you fix these disasters in yoru game... once and for all.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>So you watch one video from a top instructor that says do this, only to turn around and watch another vidoe that says <i>the exact opposite.</i></p>
			<br/>
			<p>All of a sudden,<strong>you're left confused and overwhelmed...</strong>because when it comes to online golf instruction, there is no consistency!</p>
		<br/>
		<p><strong>Think about it...</strong></p>
		<br/>
		<p>How on earth can you lower scores(and stop hitting those humiliating shots) if you're listening to 3, 5 or 10 different instructors, each of which has a different take on things?</p>
		<br/>
		<p>It's impossible. It leads to information overload, which leaves you worse off (and more confused) than when you started!</p>
